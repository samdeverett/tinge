# Tinge

**Color-matching iOS game.** Made mostly for me to practice developing and launching an app.

**Update (7/22):** Delisted from App Store (because I didn't want to continue paying the $100/yr developer fee). If you still want to play, you can clone this repository and run it locally on a Mac using Xcode. [Email me](https://samdeverett.com) if you want help with this.
